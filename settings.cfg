[Profiles]
# Define filter/sort profiles. See README.md for details.
# Examples:
#
#  profile1 = regex#=ubuntu#=:uploadRatio
#   A profile named '1' shows only torrents whose name contains ubuntu (case
#   insensitive match), sorted by upload ratio from large to small.
#   This profile can be selected from the profile menu or by pressing '1'.
#
#  profile2 = incomplete#=#=percentDone
#   A profile named '2' shows incomplete torrents sorted by progress.
#
#  profileABC = regex#=ubuntu#=:incomplete#= #& #  location#=/torrents#=peersConnected
#   A profile named 'ABC' shows only torrents that satisfy one of the
#   conditions:
#    1. Name contains ubuntu and complete;
#    2. Download location is /torrents.
#   The torrent list is sorted by number of peers connected.
#   This profile can be selected from the profile menu.

# Show all torrents, sort by name:
